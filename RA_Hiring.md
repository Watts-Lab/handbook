# RA Hiring & Onboarding Process

1. **Written Application** - Applicant completes the [application](https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_00AS9HoBXLrqWJ8). If applicant demonstrates interest in lab and has requisite skills on paper, ROM reaches out to schedule a chat/informal interview.
2. **Chat** - Led by ROM; talk to applicant about their interest in lab and research and their skillset. Answer any questions related to broad project goals. If applicant has genuine interest in lab / research and has needed skills, match applicant with relevant project lead researcher for interview.
3. **Interview** - Led by researcher; interview can be based on specific technical skills needed for the role (anything from social science coding to app to data analysis), fit with project, or whatever the project lead deems necessary. Project lead communicates final decision to ROM.
4. **Hiring** - ROM creates hiring paperwork (contract + payroll packet) and sends over to applicant, cc'ing the project lead. Send to PEFS when complete. PEFS must input their information into Workday for approval before RA can start work.
5. **Onboarding** - University has official onboarding in Workday that must be completed. This includes going in-person to verify employment authorization documents. Once that has been completed, ROM can do the following:
    - Invite them to necessary systems, preferably using university address. This includes Slack, Github, and Drive. AWS should be handled by RDE.
    - Meet/Zoom with RA and review [onboarding presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pZndxAERCmxl2aCPgXCvnMrBdYnasq5yx3cMXUe8808/edit#slide=id.p1). The goal of this space is to review the org structure and members of lab, explicitly review expectations of RAs and clearly outline next steps. Next steps from this can include:
        - Meet with Project Lead to review tasks and schedule work hours/meetings
        - Meet with RDE to review coding style, use of lab resources, AWS set up
        - Visit the lab in-person
        - Complete RA form (not linked for security reasons); includes sending info for website, getting swipe access to building and reflecting on goals
