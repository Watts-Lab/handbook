Hello, welcome to Watt's Lab! ðŸ’¯

Attached is your AWS credentials. Attached within the credentials are the username, password, and link to login to AWS. Can you please try and let me know if you are able to login?

The password policy when they ask you to change the password is the following:
If you need to reset your password, hereâ€™s the rules:

-   <span style="color:yellow">Minimum password length of 8 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters</span>
-   Minimum of three of the following mix of character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = [ ] { } | ' symbols
-   Not be identical to your AWS account name or email address
    

When you are able to login, please send me an update and I'll have more instructions for getting you access to the ParallelCluster, which we need to work to create a private key/public key pair. Thank you, Yingquan
